=============================================================================
PARTICIPANT-1: Anand Prashant Popat (apopat)
=============================================================================
ENVIRONMENT: New hadoop.ova, simple python files run using spark-submit script
=============================================================================
ACTIVITY-1:
1) Present under "Lab5->activity1->activity1.py". Implementation of Jupyter example using simple python file. 

2) titanic.csv is also present inside the folder.

3) numpy should be imported for this file to run.
==============================================================================
ACTIVITY-2:
1) Two codes, one for 2 grams, present under "Lab5->activity2->2_grams->activity2_2grams.py" and another for 3 grams under "Lab5->activity2->3_grams->activity2_3grams.py". As the name suggests, the first code implements for 2 grams while the other implements for 3 grams.

2) "input" folder for both the codes is present in their respective directories.

3) Inside folder "2_grams" is the output for 2 grams in "output_2grams" and the same for 3 grams. NOTE: This ouput is for 2 files in input.

4) new_lemmatizer.csv is also present inside both folders as it is read in the code.

5) NOTE: IN THE CASE OF RUNNING THE .py FILES INSIDE THIS SAME FOLDER, PLEASE DELETE THE OUTPUT FOLDERS, "output_2grams" and "output_3grams" BEFORE RUNNING THE .py FILES. (because it throws an error) OR RUN THEM IN SOME OTHER DIRECTORY. 
==============================================================================
Along with these, inside the main folder "lab5" are:
1) 2_grams.csv and 3_grams.csv which have the files vs time information of both grams where files are incremented by 10 at each stage starting from 2 to 100.

2) "lab5_plot_2_grams_3_grams.ipynb" is used to plot the time noted for both these grams using the above csv files.

3) Lastly, 2_grams.png and 3_grams.png represent the plots derived from the above python notebook.
